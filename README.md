The MAIN PURPOSE of this repository is to DISPLAY MY CURRENT PROGRESS in my research project. Unfortunately, some of the functionalities I use with MG5+Pythia+Delphes cannot be shown here for practical reasons (i.e. requires GBs of memory).

NOTE: This repository is a WORKING PROGRESS. To see an example of a well-functioning code, open folder "event_selection" and examine the Python codes accordingly. (I authored them completely on my own.)

Currently I am working on the codes under "statistical_analysis." The C macros use RooFit/RooStats and are named generically because they merely mark my progress. The latest progress has the highest number attached to it. "Stats_06.C" works well to calculate the local p value from a RooWorkspace file.

Feel free to add helpful comments/suggestions.
